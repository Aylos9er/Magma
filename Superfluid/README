                      SUPERFLUID PROGRAM
                      *******************

    This program is created for calculation of Gibbs free energy 
G (J/mole) and molar volume V (cm3/mole) of the C-H-O-S-N-Ar fluids
under specified temperature T (K) and pressure P (bar).

    Program works in the interactive mode, calculating point by point.
To specify point, one should specify T, P and composition. To specify
composition, one should specify the numbers of components and their mole 
fractions (Xi).

    The applicable T-P ranges are as follows:
                 Crttical Points ---> 2273.15 K,  1  bar - 1 kbar;
                                      3273.15 K,  1 kbar - 5 kbar;
                                      4000.00 K,  5 kbar - 1000 kbar.

    The component numbers are:
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------  
      1     2     3     4    5    6    7    8     9    10    11   12   13
     H2O,  CO2,  CH4,  CO,  O2,  H2,  S2,  SO2,  COS,  H2S,  N2,  NH3, Ar
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------  
A sum of Xi must be equal to 1.0

    To finish input of a point, one should type a negative number of a
component. All results are saved and appended to the SUPER.OUT file.

    The program gives the detailed information as users want to make several
calculations at different T-P-X conditions.
